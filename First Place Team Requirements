What is a Marketplace simulation?
Marketplace is an educational game that provides learners with a simulated business environment in which participants use their business knowledge and gain realistic experience. Students apply the theory from business courses in practical business situations, thus developing business acumen and critical workplace skills.

What do learners do in the simulation that develops business skills?
While playing Marketplace, teams start up and manage their own business division or company. Players build product portfolios, advertising campaigns, and distribution channels using evolving analytics data. They manage demand, sales, operations, and finances in a realistic game-world with limited resources. To succeed, students must build customer-focused businesses and stay ahead of the competition.

Marketplace simulations assess performance with the Balanced Scorecard, a managerial tool widely used in business. Players learn that to maximize their company’s performance, they must balance financial success, customer satisfaction, operational efficiency, and employee satisfaction.

What does it take to win 1st place in a Marketplace simulation?
The winning team in Marketplace is determined by the highest cumulative Balanced Scorecard within a game across several simulated business quarters. This requires consistent performance, careful attention to feedback metrics, perseverance, agility, and problem-solving skills. Therefore, the holder of this badge demonstrated the business skills and work ethic necessary to manage their company toward excellence over crucial stages of the company’s life cycle.
