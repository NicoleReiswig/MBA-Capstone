INTRODUCTION
An important aspect of running a successful start-up business is acquiring funding from potential investors based on information about the business. In this task, you will use the skills you have acquired in the MBA coursework to complete the test market phase in a business simulation. The simulation is accessed through your course. Using data from the test market phase (Q1–Q4) of the simulation, you will create and deliver a multimedia presentation (e.g., PowerPoint, Keynote, OpenOffice) for potential business investors using the attached “Presentation Template” and information from the scenario. The objective of the presentation is to obtain capital to be able to take your product fully to market.

 

You must complete the simulation through the business’s fourth quarter (Q4) before beginning this task. After working through Q4, including completing the tactical plan through Q6, you'll work through this task. After submitting Task 1, immediately submit Q4 in the simulation. Once your Task 1 has been passed, you'll be able to move forward in the simulation. 

SCENARIO
You are the owner of a start-up business that creates 3D-printed, carbon fiber bicycles. Up through the business’s third quarter (Q3), you have used your own money to fund the business. The business model shows promise, but you are now seeking an additional 2.5 million in equity funding to execute your business plan. You will create and deliver a multimedia presentation that showcases your business plan to potential investors and illustrates how the additional funding will be used and will provide a return to your investors.

REQUIREMENTS
Your submission must be your original work. No more than a combined total of 30% of the submission and no more than a 10% match to any one individual source can be directly quoted or closely paraphrased from sources, even if cited correctly. The originality report that is provided when you submit your task can be used as a guide.

 You must use the rubric to direct the creation of your submission because it provides detailed criteria that will be used to evaluate your work. Each requirement below may be evaluated by more than one rubric aspect. The rubric aspect titles may contain hyperlinks to relevant portions of the course.



A.  Attach a completed copy of each of the following:

•  a copy of the company’s completed tactical plan from the business simulation found in quarter four (Q4)

•  your multimedia presentation (e.g., PowerPoint, Keynote, OpenOffice) of your business plan, using the attached “Presentation Template,” including each of the following:

-  your presenter notes

-  the company’s quarter three cumulative balanced scorecard

-  market share or sales report
 

Note: The company’s completed tactical plan, cumulative balanced scorecard, and market share or sales report must be exported from within the simulation. You may copy and paste the information for the cumulative balanced scorecard and market share or sales report directly into the attached “Presentation Template,” or you may take a screenshot of the information to insert it into the template as an image file. The company’s completed tactical plan must be attached as a separate file, exactly as downloaded from within the simulation.
 

B.  Create a Panopto video recording (suggested length of 20–30 minutes) that includes you presenting the multimedia presentation (e.g., PowerPoint, Keynote, OpenOffice) from part A. You will present your business plan using the attached “Presentation Template” to ask venture capitalists for funding based on the scenario. The slides in your multimedia presentation should include only the main points you wish to make and required financial statements, with more extensive information included in the presenter notes section of the presentation. In the presentation of your business plan, you must do the following:
 

Note: The audiovisual recording should feature you visibly presenting the material (i.e., not in voice-over or embedded video) and should simultaneously capture both you and your multimedia presentation.
 

Note: For instructions on how to access and use Panopto, use the "Panopto How-To Videos" web link provided below. To access Panopto's website, navigate to the web link titled "Panopto Access", and then choose to log in using the “WGU” option. If prompted, log in using your WGU student portal credentials, and then it will forward you to Panopto’s website. 



To submit your recording, upload it to the Panopto drop box titled “C216: MBA Capstone – C216 (Student Creators) (Drop Box)” Once the recording has been uploaded and processed in Panopto's system, retrieve the URL of the recording from Panopto and copy and paste it into the Links option. Upload the remaining task requirements using the Attachments option.
